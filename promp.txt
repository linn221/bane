i have added new go files for models. generate graphql schema (one file per model). that will have: type X, input XInput. (X always has field Alias which is forced resolved). each will have newX mutation, and query for both instance and listing with filters that are sensible (optional fields). Implement the resolvers. make sure to follow conventions when creating service structs. Make sure all fields are resolved, models migrated, and ready to test.
for MySheet, its idea is the same as MemorySheet, keep reminding the sheet based on an interval. use the same interval. the setting of NextDate and PreviousDate happen when MySheet is query, looking for records that has today date as NextDate, then calculate the next interval, setting the PreviousDate as today. then, fetch all records with PreviousDate of today, and shows them.
